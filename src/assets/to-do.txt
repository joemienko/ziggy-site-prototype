Needs:
Homepage w/ basic about me
Gallery - to scroll through my art (all pics on Instagram @hardeasy.pokes)
Available Flash section - “Flash” are pre-drawn designs that clients can claim for a tattoo (there’s a highlight on my Instagram that shows what I have available)
It needs to be able to be updated often because once people claim them, they aren’t available anymore and I put more flash out every two months or so
Booking form - https://form.jotform.com/211890318271151
Consent form - https://form.jotform.com/211890207879162
Would be cool if they could fill these forms out on the website instead of clicking the link, but I’d need to be able to turn the form on and off because I don’t want people to try and book with me when I’m not available 
Basically, I’d like to be able to show if my books are open or not when someone visits the site. When they are open, the link/form will be available
